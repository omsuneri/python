# Tuple in python is similar to list but it is immutable.
name = ('John', 'Doe', 25)

# Tuple methods
print(len(name)) # returns length of tuple
print(name.count('John')) # returns count of John in tuple
print(name.index('Doe')) # returns index of Doe in tuple

# you can also concatenate two tuples just like strings
